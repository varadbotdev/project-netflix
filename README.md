# Netflix Clone

This project is part of the AICTE internship program from IBM conducted by SkillsBuild, focusing on frontend development. The internship duration was 6 weeks, during which I worked on developing a Netflix clone.

## Project Overview

The Netflix clone is a web application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main objective of this project was to replicate the visual appearance of the Netflix home page and demonstrate proficiency in frontend development skills.

The project primarily focuses on developing the frontend components of the Netflix home page, including the header, hero section, content rows, and footer. While the emphasis is on the user interface, basic JavaScript functionality was incorporated to enhance interactivity.

Please note that this project is intended for educational purposes and does not include advanced features such as user authentication, video playback, or database integration.
